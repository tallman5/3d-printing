## Mods
| |Name|For|Description|
|----------|---|---|---|
|![Cable Rib Cage](images/crc-30x100.png)|[Cable Rib Cage](stl/general/)|Rat Rig|Simple "loom" for running wires. Doubles as an overhang and string test :smile:.|
|![EVA Back with Cable Guide](images/back-cable-guide.png)|[EVA Back w/ Cable Guide](stl/eva/back-cable-guide.stl)|EVA|Merged the back and cable guide. Added a hole for using PTFE for cable support.|
|![Filament Runout Sensor](images/filament-runout-sensor.png)|[Filament Runout Sensor](stl/general/filament-runout-sensor.stl)|Anywhere|Mounts onto 2020 frames, uses standard microswitch|
|![Panel Handle](images/panel-handle.png)|[Panel Handle](stl/general/panel-handle.stl)|V-Core Panels|Light duty panel handle. Uses M6s, hole spacing is 89mm. This was not designed to lift an entire printer!|
|![Panel Magnets](images/panel-magnets-glass.png)|[Panel Magnets](stl/general/panel-magnets/)|V-Core Panels|Panel mounting with embedded magnets. Edit the gcode to pause just before the bridges to instert the 10x4 magnets. For a .2 layer height, it's layer 30 for the holder and 25 for the mount. Test one of each before printing a bunch of them.|

|![X/Y Sensorless Endstops](images/sensorless-endstops.png)<img src="" width="200px" />|[X/Y Sensorless Endstops](stl/rat-rig/)|V-Core 3.0|Longer bumpers needed for sensorless homing on a v3.0|
|![Z Locks](images/z-locks-installed.png)|[Z Locks](stl/voron/z-locks/readme.md)|Voron 2.4|Use as helping hands instead of zip ties|

## BOMs
The BOMs below are generated right from the CAD files.
The script is in the [src/fusion-scripts](src/fusion-scipts/) folder.

The BOMs may have affiliate links to parts used during self-sourcing.
The prices won't be higher, however you can show support for this project. Thanks!
